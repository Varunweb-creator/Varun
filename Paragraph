A paragraph is a series of related sentences that develop a central idea, known as the topic. It serves to express thoughts clearly and specifically, ensuring that each paragraph focuses on a single idea or point. To write effective paragraphs, consider the following:
Structure: A paragraph should have a clear beginning, middle, and end, often starting with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea. 
2
Unity: Each paragraph should maintain thematic unity, meaning all sentences should support the central idea.
